# spa-s-lattice
This code generates the set of all stable matchings for a given SPA-S instance, as well as its dominance graph 

**readinput.py** reads in the given SPA-S instance into a suitable data structure
<br>
**enumerateSMs.py** enumerates all the stable matchings in the given instance
<br>
**dominance.py** returns the dominance graph representing the lattice structure of the stable matchings
